# Practical consideration
* Resource limitation
* Modifiability
* Constructability
* Synchronicity
* Evolvability
* Repairability

# Modules characteristic
* Hierarchy
* Detect groups of similar conditions  
* Generally similar but detailed differences
* Detect conditions on different levels of complexity
* More Communication/Info exchange within than between --> minimize information as far as possible

| Modules properties   | Reason for module property in terms of practical consideration |
| :------------- | :------------- |
|A physical resource performing a group of information process |  Resource limitation -> share similar processes across tasks, efficient execution of similar processes |
| Organized into hierarchy | Resource limitation |
| Information exchange minimized as far as possible| Modifiability   |
| Outputs have partially ambiguous information meanings | Evolvability, Modifiability |
| Resource layering| Synchronicity |
| Conditions defined on different level of complexity | Resource limitation, Evolvability|
| General similarity bur detailed differences | Constructability, Resource, repairability |
| Frequency modulation of sensory inputs into modules | Synchronicity, resource limitation|


# Defining conditions
Huge range of possibility
Picking the right conditions
Side effect of condition changes
Do not know best conditions in advance - resources

# What, where and when to record conditions
