## cortex

Major structure features :
Columns

Layers : 6,
Areas : difference between areas :
Connectivity : 99.8% (), 0.2% go to hippocampus, basal ganglia all, amydgala, hypothalamus, thalamus, (basal ganglia to thalamus)
Cerebellum (goes back to thalamus)

Visual processing :
V1 --> V2 --> V3 ----> TE (dorsal)
        |---> V4 ----> PP (ventral)
difference between dorsal and ventral :
Dorsal : Motion, position
Ventral : What


auditory processing :
What and Where

Communication between areas :


Electronic property
Different frequency
Beta  : 12 - 30 thinking
Gamma : 30 - 80 attention
Theta : 5 - 12 recording memory

Modules :
higher modules  = lots of more details, much more connectivity, information exchange within a module, similar but detailed difference

cortex :
areas :
columns : 
layers : complexity of receptive fields, more specific at deeper layers.
neurons : recepting fields

Layer six goes to thalamus and other Cortical areas
Layer five goes to basal


Information models for a neuron:
neurons : different recepting fields
dendrites : different dendrites from different areas (i.e. different sources)
branches
synapses
kinase cascades L detecting conditions relvaovtions

Informal model for a layer :
