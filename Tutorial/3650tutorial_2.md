# Electronic Systems
* printed circoit assmples
* integrated circoit
* standard cells
* logic, nor-gate
* resistors, transistors, capactors


# High level :
* more approximate
* describe complete process

# Low level :
* more qualitative
* describe small segement
* more informal


# Major components :
* Neuron : dendrite, nuclbus, axon, soma, synapses(spine)
* Similarities between neurons: dendrite, axon, synapse, neurontransimiters,  voltage (-70 mv),
* difference between neurons : different receptors,  excitetory/inhibitory, local or long distance projection,

# Synaptic changes
* seconds : more ca++ (working memory)
* minus : "expand" channels and pass more sodium (priming memory)
* hours : number of channels increased
* long : increase the size of synapse

# Information Process
* neurons : detect recepting field
* dendrites :  detect more complex condition within different sources
* branches : detect multiple elements simultaneously : condition
* synapses : detect one element information
* chemical cascades :
